# gomoku

gomoku for two human players

## Manual
In game, use dpad (normally arrow keys) to move cursor, use button o (üÖæÔ∏è) to place chess piece at current position of cursor, use button x (‚ùé) to reset current game

When game over, use button o to restart a new game

The black and white player use the same cursor, and place chess piece in turn. When a player linked 5 adjacent pieces of the player's color horizontally, vertically or diagonally, game over and this player wins

This game will not call a draw, if there is no place for new chess piece, or all players are impossible to link 5 adjacent pieces, the players need to reset the game manually
